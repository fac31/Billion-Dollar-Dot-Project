      <p>
        In the 1980s, Thatcher and Reagan championed a radical new idea: Individuals should be free to pursue wealth
        and governments should get out of the way. Their ideas inspired the World. Countries vied to attract big
        businesses and the wealthy by dismantling regulations and enabling wealth to flow across borders.
      <p>
        Businesses thrived. But another transformation was happening too: The World&rsquo;s wealth was concentrating
        in the hands of the few. In richer countries, we have reached an extreme: the totality of wealth is now in
        private hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the UK, Public Wealth has dropped from 102% of national income in 1980 to -106% in 2020. One of the
        fundamental mechanisms for addressing this ever-widening gap between rich and poor is the
        progressive tax system, where individuals contribute in accordance with their earnings. For a long time, the
        amount Billionaires pay in taxes have been shrouded in mystery. Until now. Recent
        studies have gathered just enough data to start painting a clearer picture. The findings reveal a stark
        truth:
      </p>
      <p> Billionaires are paying significantly less tax than anyone else.
      </p>
      <p> This represents how much each income group pays in taxes. This group are the majority: The bottom 90% of
        earners. When you average out across the three countries
        studied, they&rsquo;re all paying around the same percentage, 36%. This group are the Billionaires. This time
        they&rsquo;re the smallest dot: Because they&rsquo;re paying
        the least tax. As a percentage of income, it works out to be about 25%. But that figure is hiding a crucial
        detail: Billionaires tend to keep their tax-vulnerable incomes low. Instead, the majority of their wealth
        sits in things like dividends or assets and they borrow against those assets. Take Elon Musk for example, who
        earned no salary in 2023 and borrowed the $13 billion to buy Twitter from interest free loans off the back of
        his
        wealth portfolio.
      </p>
      <p> If you take their tax rate as a percentage of their wealth, it&rsquo;s close to 0%.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the dance of wealth and taxation, the savvy wealthy individual has long mastered the art of sidestepping
        high
        tax rates, often without straying into the realm of outright evasion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the 80s, countries have competed to attract Billionaires and multinational companies by effectively
        facilitating this tax dodge: As a result, the average corporation income tax rate fell by half in the space of
        three decades. The rich have grown exponentially richer, faster than anyone else, leading us to crash land
        where
        we are now: a Topsy Turvy World where the wealthiest pay the lowest effective tax rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The EU Tax Observatory, a Research Institute run out of the Paris School of Economics, argue that this reality
        is not inevitable. They propose a bold solution: The total global tax paid by a billionaire should not fall
        below 2% of their wealth. Put simply: If Bloombery or Forbes can figure out how much someone is worth, so
        should
        the taxman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Global cooperation may seem like a pipe dream. After all, wealthy individuals offer huge benefits to countries
        who make them feel welcome. But recent history can inspire: In 2021, 140 countries agreed on a minimum 15% tax
        rate for multinational corporations. The rule has holes and snags, but itâ€™s progress. Another leap forward has
        been the automatic exchange of banking information since 2017, which led to a two-thirds reduction in offshore
        tax evasion within a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
        The possibility of international cooperation is real, but it&rsquo;s also possible for countries to make
        significant progress alone: Only Thirty counties host more than 10 billionaires. Any of those countries could
        decide to enforce a minimum tax on wealthy long-term residents, preventing them from amassing fortunes
        domestically only to relocate their wealth abroad.

      <p> Let&rsquo;s get back to this dot. Many in the Billionaires Club have vastly more than just a billion
        dollars. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to imagine how much money that is, so let&rsquo;s make this dot represent one
        billion dollars.

      <p> Right here. It is hiding in plain sight.
      </p>
      <p> If a 2% minimum tax on billionaires is introduced, we would raise $214 billion from less than 3000
        individuals.
